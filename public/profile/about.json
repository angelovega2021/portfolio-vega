    "about": "I began my career at Accenture through the Avanade bootcamp, a program focused on building web applications. After completing the training, I was deployed to a project that primarily utilized jQuery for developing web components.\n\nSince 2018, I’ve been working extensively with React.js—starting with class-based components and later transitioning to modern development practices using React Hooks. My experience includes building dynamic, scalable web applications, collaborating closely with UX designers to deliver rapid solutions, and contributing long-term improvements through structured ticketing and planning systems.\n\nWith a strong foundation in Agile methodologies since 2014, I actively participate in sprint ceremonies to help drive efficient and iterative development cycles. I use Jest for unit testing React components and containers, enabling realistic data simulations and ensuring high-quality builds throughout the CI/CD pipeline.\n\nBeyond front-end development, I also work on the back end by creating custom APIs to integrate with front-end systems, optimizing both data flow and application performance. I'm committed to staying current with JavaScript advancements and have explored modern technologies such as Bun.js to continually expand my skill set.",
